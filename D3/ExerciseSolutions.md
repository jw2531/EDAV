Part C: Interactivity

4. Add the same event listern to the ellipse.

``` js
d3.select("ellipse").on("mouseover", goyellow);
```

5. Create a function `goblue()` that changes the fill color to blue.

``` js
function goblue() {d3.select(this).attr("fill", "blue")};
```

6. Add event listeners to the circle and ellipse that will trigger a call to `goblue()` on a *mouseout*.

``` js
d3.select("circle").on("mouseout", goblue);
d3.select("ellipse").on("mouseout", goblue);
```
